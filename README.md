# LSTMModel-NextWordPrediction

Next Word Prediction using LSTM is a project aimed at predicting the next word in a sentence using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network. This model is trained on a text dataset, learning word patterns and context to generate a probable next word based on the input sequence. The project is ideal for applications in typing assistants, chatbots, and other language models that require predictive text capabilities.** _Uses LSTM model to predict the next word of sentence (Given three words of sentence and it predicts then four word of sentence._**

# Project Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to enhance user experience in text-based applications by providing intelligent word suggestions. Such a tool can be used in messaging apps, word processors, and various NLP-powered platforms to increase typing efficiency and accuracy.
